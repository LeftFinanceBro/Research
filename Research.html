<h2>Were the Nazis Socialist?</h2>
<p class='description text'> Nazi Germany was socially far right and economically centrist. The economy was not a 
	socialist one but not quite a free market capitalist one either. Nazi leaders and economists described
	an economic and political system that was not socialist and their policies demonstrate those descriptions.
	The primary economic focus of Nazi Germany was to become self-reliant in order to pursue warfare and 
	their goals of Lebensraum.</p>

<h3>Privatization in the Nazi economy</h3>

<button class='collapsible button'>Bel 2006</button>
<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>The word privatization was coined
	to describe Nazi econmic policy!<a href='https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.20.3.187'>https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.20.3.187</a></p>
<blockquote class='description_quote'>“the German word “Reprivatisierung” appears, which translates as
	“reprivatization.” In that article, Heinz Marschner (1934, p. 587) wrote: “The following essay
	makes an interesting proposal: the reprivatization of urban transportation, which after the period 
	of inflation came under public control, especially in the hands of local governments.” This text 
	comments on the German National Socialist (Nazi) government’s posi- tion that the ownership of
	urban transportation should be returned to the private sector. Several months later, Hans Baumgarten 
	(1934) used “Reprivatisierung” in his article on banking policy in Germany (p. 1645): “Once there
	have been established the crucial factors that must be met in order to proceed with future reprivatization 
	and future distribution of dividends, it has to be added that, after all, reprivatization also 
	depends on the possibility itself of distributing dividend” (Bel 190).</blockquote>

<h2>Nazi privatization was complicated</h2>
<p class='description text'>
	It wasnt necessarily ideologically capitalist or socialist.

<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>Nazi privatization in the mid 30's was partly to increase revenue
	and the savings rate as they prepared for war. During 1934-1937 the Nazi government
	attained ~1.37% of fiscal revenue from selling state assets.<a href='http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf'>http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf</a></p>
