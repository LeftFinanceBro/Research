<h1>Were the Nazis Socialist?</h1>
<p class='description text'> Nazi Germany was socially far right and economically centrist. The economy was not a 
	socialist one but not quite a free market capitalist one either. Nazi leaders and economists described
	an economic and political system that was not socialist and their policies demonstrate those descriptions.
	The primary economic focus of Nazi Germany was to become self-reliant in order to pursue warfare and 
	their goals of Lebensraum.</p>

<h2>Privatization in the Nazi economy</h2>

<button class='collapsible button'>Bel 2006</button>
<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>The word privatization was coined
	to describe Nazi econmic policy!<a href='https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.20.3.187'>https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.20.3.187</a></p>
<blockquote class='description_quote'>“the German word “Reprivatisierung” appears, which translates as
	“reprivatization.” In that article, Heinz Marschner (1934, p. 587) wrote: “The following essay
	makes an interesting proposal: the reprivatization of urban transportation, which after the period 
	of inflation came under public control, especially in the hands of local governments.” This text 
	comments on the German National Socialist (Nazi) government’s posi- tion that the ownership of
	urban transportation should be returned to the private sector. Several months later, Hans Baumgarten 
	(1934) used “Reprivatisierung” in his article on banking policy in Germany (p. 1645): “Once there
	have been established the crucial factors that must be met in order to proceed with future reprivatization 
	and future distribution of dividends, it has to be added that, after all, reprivatization also 
	depends on the possibility itself of distributing dividend” (Bel 190).</blockquote>

<h4>Nazi privatization was complicated</h4>
<p class='description text'>
	It wasnt necessarily ideologically capitalist or socialist but motivated by other reasons.

<button class='collapsible button'>A discussion of Bel 2009</button>
<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>Nazi Germany did go agaisnt the grain by privatizing previously state owned firms while other western nations did not but the following quote must be further contextualized.<a href='http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf'>http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote class='description_quote'>“in the early 1930s in Germany. The state took over a large industrial concern, large commercial banks, and other minor firms. In the mid-1930s, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in western capitalistic countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s. Privatization was used as a political tool to enhance support for the government and for the Nazi Party”</blockquote>
<p class='description text'> The Nazis had no ideological tie to privatization for the sake of private property expansion. they were not pro-free market. But this doesnt mean they were socialist ether.
</p>
<blockquote class='description_quote'> “However, it is worth noting that the general orientation of the Nazi economic policy was the exact opposite of that of the EU countries in the late 1990s: Whereas the modern privatization in the EU has been parallel to liberalization policies, in Nazi Germany privatization was applied within a framework of increasing control of the state over the whole economy through regulation and political interference.”</blockquote>
<p class='description text'>The author believed that they were economically centrist.</p>
<blockquote class='description_quote'>Even if Hitler was an enemy of free market economies (Overy, 1994, p. 1), he could by no means be considered a sympathizer of economic socialism or nationalization of private firms (Heiden, 1944, p. 642). The Nazi regime rejected liberalism, and was strongly against free competition and regulation of the economy by market mechanisms (Barkai, 1990, p. 10). Still, as a social Darwinist, Hitler was reluctant to totally dispense with private property and competition (Turner, 1985a, p. 71; Hayes, 1987, p. 71).</blockquote>

<button class='collapsible button'>Revenue gain (Bel 2009)</button>
<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>Nazi privatization in the mid 30's was partly to increase revenue
	and the savings rate as they prepared for war. During 1934-1937 the Nazi government
	attained ~1.37% of fiscal revenue from selling state assets.<a href='http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf'>http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf</a></p>

<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>Hitler constructed his own conception of socialism.</p>
<blockquote class='descpription_quote'>"Whoever is prepared to make the national cause his own to such an extent that he 
	knows no higher ideal than the welfare of the nation; whoever has understood our great national anthem,
	"Deutschland uber Alles," to mean nothing in the wide world surpasses in his eyes this Germany, people and land --
	that man is a socialist."</blockquote>

<button class='collapsible button'>1935 Speech</button>
<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>Hitler supported some conception of private property rights and criticized the soviet conception of property rights.</p>
<blockquote class='descpription_quote'>"We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility."</blockquote>
<p class='description text'>Hitler was not a fan of the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>
<blockquote class='description_quote'>"National Socialism fights for the reconciliation and consequent adjustment of the differences in life and the union of all for common benefits. Bolshevism teaches the overcoming of an alleged class rule by the dictatorship of the power of a different class."

<button class='collapsible button'>1938 Speech</button>
<div class='collapsible-content invisible'>
<p class='description text'>Hitler at the very least hated marxism. Stated true socialism is pro-property?</p>
<blockquote class='descpription_quote'>"Socialist' I define from the word 'social; meaning in the main social equity . A Socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his personal efficiency. Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.** Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are false"</blockquote>
